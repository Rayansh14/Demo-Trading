The actions of market participants can be visualized, using a stock chart. Over time, patterns are formed within these charts, and each pattern conveys a certain message. The job of a technical analyst is to identify these patterns and develop a point of view.\n\nLike any research technique, technical analysis stands on a bunch of assumptions. As a technical analysis practitioner, you need to trade the markets keeping these assumptions in perspective. Of course, we will understand these assumptions in detail as we proceed along.")
